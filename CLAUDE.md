# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A local MCP server + CLI (`tv`) that bridges Claude Code to a live TradingView Desktop app via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP, port 9222). 81 MCP tools for reading chart state, developing Pine Script, driving chart UI, and running a rules-based "morning brief" over a watchlist. No data leaves the machine; no TradingView servers are contacted directly — everything goes through the already-authenticated Desktop app.

## Development

### Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run test:unit    # offline, no TradingView needed — cli.test.js + pine_analyze.test.js
npm run test:cli     # offline — CLI help/exit-code/error-handling tests
npm test              # ⚠️ also runs tests/e2e.test.js, which REQUIRES TradingView Desktop
npm run test:e2e      #    running with --remote-debugging-port=9222 — will hang/fail without it
npm run test:all      # unit + cli + e2e together

node --test --test-name-pattern="<substring>" tests/cli.test.js   # run a single test by name
tv status              # (after `npm link`) verify the CDP connection to TradingView
```

There is no lint or build step configured in `package.json` — don't invent one.

When changing anything under `src/`, prefer `npm run test:unit` first since it doesn't require TradingView running. Only reach for `test:e2e` when you have TradingView Desktop open with CDP enabled (`./scripts/launch_tv_debug_mac.sh` or the Windows/Linux equivalents, or the `tv_launch` tool).

### Architecture

Three interfaces share one core — always add new capability to `core/` first, then thin wrappers on top:

- **`src/core/*.js`** — the actual logic. Talks to TradingView exclusively through `src/connection.js`, which holds a single retried CDP client and an `evaluate(expression)` helper that runs JS inside the TradingView page's context. `KNOWN_PATHS` in that file lists unofficial TradingView internals (e.g. `window.TradingViewApi._activeChartWidgetWV`) discovered by probing — see `RESEARCH.md` for how those were found.
- **`src/tools/*.js`** — MCP tool definitions: zod input schema + call into the matching `core/*.js` function + `jsonResult()` (from `_format.js`) to wrap the response. Each file exports a `registerXTools(server)` function; all of them are registered in `src/server.js`, which also carries the tool-selection guide baked into the MCP server's `instructions` field.
- **`src/cli/commands/*.js`** — CLI wrappers around the *same* core functions, exposed as the `tv` bin (`src/cli/index.js`) through a small zero-dependency router (`src/cli/router.js`, built on `node:util.parseArgs`).

So a new feature is: one function in `core/`, then a matching entry in `tools/` and/or `cli/commands/`. Keep `core/` as the single source of truth — MCP and CLI wrappers should stay thin.

Other structure:
- **`skills/*/SKILL.md`** — step-by-step workflows for multi-tool tasks (`pine-develop`, `chart-analysis`, `multi-symbol-scan`, `replay-practice`, `strategy-report`). Read the relevant one before improvising a workflow that already has a documented procedure — `pine-develop` in particular defines the write → push → compile → fix-errors → screenshot loop for Pine Script work.
- **`rules.json`** (tracked in git, `rules.example.json` is the blank template) — the user's watchlist, bias criteria, and risk rules; `morning_brief` reads it automatically.
- **`scripts/current.pine`** (gitignored scratch file) — working buffer for the Pine Editor push/pull scripts (`scripts/pine_push.js`, `scripts/pine_pull.js`), used by the `pine-develop` workflow.
- **`ICT_STRATEGY_SPEC.md`** — living spec for an in-progress custom ICT/smart-money-concepts indicator built on top of this server; not part of the MCP server itself, just a working doc for that side project.

### Trade alert watcher (Pushover)

`tv trade-alert check` (`src/core/trade_alert.js`) is a standalone, session-independent alert path — it does **not** go through Claude Code. It scans every symbol in `rules.json`'s `watchlist` across every timeframe in `scan_timeframes` (falls back to just `default_timeframe` if unset) using the same `chart.js`/`data.js` primitives `morning.runBrief()` uses (but not that function itself, since it only samples one timeframe), then calls the Anthropic API directly (separate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, billed per-token — see `.env.example`) with the same `rules.json` bias_criteria/risk_rules verbatim, instructed to use the higher timeframe(s) for trend/bias and lower timeframe(s) to time the entry trigger (standard ICT multi-timeframe confluence), for a genuine structured-output confidence judgment. It pushes a notification via Pushover (`PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` / `PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN` — see pushover.net) when confidence crosses `ALERT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (default 85). The message states LONG/SHORT, the entry timeframe, and a directional probability, not just a bare confidence number. A cooldown (`ALERT_COOLDOWN_MINUTES`, default 120) per symbol+direction is tracked in `~/.tradingview-mcp/alert_state.json` to avoid repeat pushes. Requires TradingView Desktop + CDP running, same as everything else here. Schedule it with `scripts/com.tradingview-mcp.trade-alert.plist.example` (macOS launchd) or an equivalent cron job — copy it, fill in the placeholders, and `launchctl load` it. Use `--dry-run` to test without sending a notification or touching cooldown state.

Each alert also attaches a chart screenshot, captured via `capture.captureScreenshot()` and sent as a direct binary attachment in the Pushover API call (multipart `FormData`, up to 2.5MB) — no public URL or tunnel needed, since Pushover (unlike Twilio MMS) accepts the image bytes directly in the request. (An earlier version of this feature used Twilio SMS/MMS, which required a `cloudflared` quick-tunnel workaround to give Twilio a fetchable `MediaUrl`; that was dropped in favor of Pushover specifically to avoid Twilio's A2P 10DLC compliance registration, which blocked delivery entirely.) If the screenshot step fails for any reason, it falls back to a text-only notification rather than blocking the alert.

### Known fragility

- `pine_push.js` / `pine_pull.js` locate the Pine Editor's Monaco instance by walking React-fiber internals off `.monaco-editor.pine-editor-monaco` DOM nodes. TradingView can leave more than one such element in the DOM (a stale hidden instance ahead of the live one) — the code must scan all matches for the one whose fiber actually exposes a `monacoEnv`, not just take the first `querySelector` hit, or injection silently fails with "Could not inject into Pine editor".
- Symbol resolution (`chart_set_symbol` / `tv symbol --set`) goes through TradingView's own search and can resolve a bare ticker to an unexpected instrument — e.g. `GBPUSD` resolving to a CME futures contract instead of spot forex, depending on the account's linked broker. Prefer exchange-qualified symbols (`OANDA:GBPUSD`, not `GBPUSD`/`FX:GBPUSD`) and verify the result with `chart_get_state` / `tv state` (check the exchange, not just the ticker) after setting.
- **Pushing a genuinely *new* Pine script (as opposed to editing an already-open one) is currently unreliable end-to-end (found 2026-07-16, cost a full session to characterize).** Symptoms and root causes found so far:
  - `core.newScript()` (and `tv pine new`) does **not** create a new script entity — it just calls `m.editor.setValue(template)` on whatever Monaco instance `FIND_MONACO` happens to find. If another script is already loaded, this silently overwrites the in-memory (unsaved) buffer of *that* script instead of creating anything new. The only UI action that reliably creates a real, separate, saved script is **"Make a copy…"** from the script dropdown (requires a real, already-loaded/saved script as the source — it's greyed out for "Untitled script"). `tv pine open <name>` followed by the dropdown → "Make a copy…" is the reliable path; confirm success via `fetch('https://pine-facade.tradingview.com/pine-facade/list/?filter=saved')` (run through `Runtime.evaluate` in the page context) showing two distinct `scriptIdPart` entries, not by trusting the visible title.
  - **Programmatically changing an editor's content does not reliably work at all**, by any method tried: `editor.setValue()`, `model.setValue()`, `editor.executeEdits()`, and simulated real keystrokes (CDP `Input` domain: click to focus + Cmd+A + `Input.insertText`, even after calling the editor's own `.focus()` first) all either silently no-op or — worse — insert at a stale cursor position instead of replacing the selection, corrupting the buffer (observed: original content duplicated with new content spliced into the middle of an existing line, producing a real Pine syntax error like `Mismatched input 'X' expecting <SET 'end of line without line continuation'>`). Root cause not fully isolated; suspect the editor's model is somehow decoupled from what's rendered/compiled for a subset of Monaco instances still left in the DOM from earlier interactions in the same TradingView process lifetime. **Workaround: none found yet.** A fresh TradingView Desktop relaunch does *not* reset this on its own the way it does for other Monaco staleness. Before spending more time on it, consider using `fetch()`-based reads of `pine-facade/get/{scriptIdPart}/{version}` (via `Runtime.evaluate`) to verify ground truth cheaply at every step rather than trusting the visible editor or any "success" return value from a push/set call.
  - If a push corrupts a script this way, **the corruption is real and gets saved** if you `Ctrl+S`/click Save afterward — verify with the `pine-facade/get` fetch above *before* saving, every time. A script's `modified`/`updated` timestamp from `pine-facade/list` is the cheapest reliable tripwire: if it hasn't changed, nothing you did actually reached the cloud, regardless of what any local tool reported.
  - Deleting a broken script via the trash icon in the "Open my script" dialog could not be made to work reliably via CDP-synthetic clicks in this session (tried: raw-coordinate clicks off a screenshot — wrong coordinate space, screenshots are not 1:1 with CSS pixels; `getBoundingClientRect()`-derived coordinates via real `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`; direct `.click()` / synthetic `MouseEvent` dispatch on the SVG and its ancestors). The row's own "open this script" click handler fires reliably; the trash icon's does not. Left as an open problem — if you hit this, it's cosmetic (an unattached, unused script sitting in the list) and safe to leave for the user to delete by hand in 2 seconds, rather than a signal to keep retrying automation.
  - **Found and fixed (2026-07-20): `FIND_MONACO` in `src/core/pine.js` used `document.querySelector('.monaco-editor.pine-editor-monaco')`, which returns the *first* DOM match — often a stale, invisible leftover instance from an earlier session (TradingView accumulates these; observed up to 3 at once, holding stale content from earlier failed pushes), not the currently visible/active one.** This was the root cause of several `pine get`/`pine open` "Could not open Pine Editor or Monaco not found" failures and of reads silently returning stale or empty content. Fixed by scanning all matches for one that's actually laid out (`offsetParent !== null && rect.width > 0 && rect.height > 0`) and, once its fiber yields a `monacoEnv`, matching the specific editor instance via `editors[e].getDomNode() === container` rather than blindly taking `editors[0]` (an env can expose multiple Monaco editor instances beyond the main code pane). Verified fix against a live 3-Monaco-instance DOM (2 stale off-screen editors + 1 real visible one) — old code matched the stale one, new code correctly matches the visible one. Even with this fixed, note that a *read-only* `getValue()`/`getDomNode()` probe in this session was immediately followed by TradingView spontaneously opening a new blank "Unsaved version" tab in the Pine Editor UI — cause unconfirmed (possibly an unrelated TradingView Desktop quirk, not caused by the read), but a reminder to always re-verify via the `pine-facade` fetch (not the visible editor) before trusting any editor state, and never to `Ctrl+S`/Save without that check.

## Tool Selection — Decision Tree

### "What's on my chart right now?"
1. `chart_get_state` → symbol, timeframe, chart type, list of all indicators with entity IDs
2. `data_get_study_values` → current numeric values from all visible indicators (RSI, MACD, BBands, EMAs, etc.)
3. `quote_get` → real-time price, OHLC, volume for current symbol

### "What levels/lines/labels are showing?"
Custom Pine indicators draw with `line.new()`, `label.new()`, `table.new()`, `box.new()`. These are invisible to normal data tools. Use:

1. `data_get_pine_lines` → horizontal price levels drawn by indicators (deduplicated, sorted high→low)
2. `data_get_pine_labels` → text annotations with prices (e.g., "PDH 24550", "Bias Long ✓")
3. `data_get_pine_tables` → table data formatted as rows (e.g., session stats, analytics dashboards)
4. `data_get_pine_boxes` → price zones / ranges as {high, low} pairs

Use `study_filter` parameter to target a specific indicator by name substring (e.g., `study_filter: "Profiler"`).

### "Give me price data"
- `data_get_ohlcv` with `summary: true` → compact stats (high, low, range, change%, avg volume, last 5 bars)
- `data_get_ohlcv` without summary → all bars (use `count` to limit, default 100)
- `quote_get` → single latest price snapshot

### "Analyze my chart" (full report workflow)
1. `quote_get` → current price
2. `data_get_study_values` → all indicator readings
3. `data_get_pine_lines` → key price levels from custom indicators
4. `data_get_pine_labels` → labeled levels with context (e.g., "Settlement", "ASN O/U")
5. `data_get_pine_tables` → session stats, analytics tables
6. `data_get_ohlcv` with `summary: true` → price action summary
7. `capture_screenshot` → visual confirmation

### "Run my morning routine"
1. `morning_brief` → scans watchlist from `rules.json`, reads indicators, applies bias/risk criteria
2. `session_save` → persist today's brief to `~/.tradingview-mcp/sessions/`
3. `session_get` → retrieve today's (or yesterday's) saved brief for comparison

### "Change the chart"
- `chart_set_symbol` → switch ticker (e.g., "AAPL", "ES1!", "NYMEX:CL1!") — see symbol-resolution caveat above
- `chart_set_timeframe` → switch resolution (e.g., "1", "5", "15", "60", "D", "W")
- `chart_set_type` → switch chart style (Candles, HeikinAshi, Line, Area, Renko, etc.)
- `chart_manage_indicator` → add or remove studies (use full name: "Relative Strength Index", not "RSI")
- `chart_scroll_to_date` → jump to a date (ISO format: "2025-01-15")
- `chart_set_visible_range` → zoom to exact date range (unix timestamps)

### "Work on Pine Script"
Follow the `pine-develop` skill. Summary:
1. `pine_set_source` → inject code into editor
2. `pine_smart_compile` → compile with auto-detection + error check
3. `pine_get_errors` → read compilation errors
4. `pine_get_console` → read log.info() output
5. `pine_get_source` → read current code back (WARNING: can be very large for complex scripts)
6. `pine_save` → save to TradingView cloud
7. `pine_new` → create blank indicator/strategy/library
8. `pine_open` → load a saved script by name

### "Practice trading with replay"
1. `replay_start` with `date: "2025-03-01"` → enter replay mode
2. `replay_step` → advance one bar
3. `replay_autoplay` → auto-advance (set speed with `speed` param in ms)
4. `replay_trade` with `action: "buy"/"sell"/"close"` → execute trades
5. `replay_status` → check position, P&L, current date
6. `replay_stop` → return to realtime

### "Screen multiple symbols"
- `batch_run` with `symbols: ["ES1!", "NQ1!", "YM1!"]` and `action: "screenshot"` or `"get_ohlcv"`

### "Draw on the chart"
- `draw_shape` → horizontal_line, trend_line, rectangle, text (pass point + optional point2)
- `draw_list` → see what's drawn
- `draw_remove_one` → remove by ID
- `draw_clear` → remove all

### "Manage alerts"
- `alert_create` → set price alert (condition: "crossing", "greater_than", "less_than")
- `alert_list` → view active alerts
- `alert_delete` → remove alerts

### "Navigate the UI"
- `ui_open_panel` → open/close pine-editor, strategy-tester, watchlist, alerts, trading
- `ui_click` → click buttons by aria-label, text, or data-name
- `layout_switch` → load a saved layout by name
- `ui_fullscreen` → toggle fullscreen
- `capture_screenshot` → take a screenshot (regions: "full", "chart", "strategy_tester")

### "TradingView isn't running"
- `tv_launch` → auto-detect and launch TradingView with CDP on Mac/Win/Linux
- `tv_health_check` → verify connection is working

## Context Management Rules

These tools can return large payloads. Follow these rules to avoid context bloat:

1. **Always use `summary: true` on `data_get_ohlcv`** unless you specifically need individual bars
2. **Always use `study_filter`** on pine tools when you know which indicator you want — don't scan all studies unnecessarily
3. **Never use `verbose: true`** on pine tools unless the user specifically asks for raw drawing data with IDs/colors
4. **Avoid calling `pine_get_source`** on complex scripts — it can return 200KB+. Only read if you need to edit the code.
5. **Avoid calling `data_get_indicator`** on protected/encrypted indicators — their inputs are encoded blobs. Use `data_get_study_values` instead for current values.
6. **Use `capture_screenshot`** for visual context instead of pulling large datasets — a screenshot is ~300KB but gives you the full visual picture
7. **Call `chart_get_state` once** at the start to get entity IDs, then reference them — don't re-call repeatedly
8. **Cap your OHLCV requests** — `count: 20` for quick analysis, `count: 100` for deeper work, `count: 500` only when specifically needed

### Output Size Estimates (compact mode)
| Tool | Typical Output |
|------|---------------|
| `quote_get` | ~200 bytes |
| `data_get_study_values` | ~500 bytes (all indicators) |
| `data_get_pine_lines` | ~1-3 KB per study (deduplicated levels) |
| `data_get_pine_labels` | ~2-5 KB per study (capped at 50) |
| `data_get_pine_tables` | ~1-4 KB per study (formatted rows) |
| `data_get_pine_boxes` | ~1-2 KB per study (deduplicated zones) |
| `data_get_ohlcv` (summary) | ~500 bytes |
| `data_get_ohlcv` (100 bars) | ~8 KB |
| `capture_screenshot` | ~300 bytes (returns file path, not image data) |

## Tool Conventions

- All tools return `{ success: true/false, ... }`
- Entity IDs (from `chart_get_state`) are session-specific — don't cache across sessions
- Pine indicators must be **visible** on chart for pine graphics tools to read their data
- `chart_manage_indicator` requires **full indicator names**: "Relative Strength Index" not "RSI", "Moving Average Exponential" not "EMA", "Bollinger Bands" not "BB"
- Screenshots save to `screenshots/` directory with timestamps
- OHLCV capped at 500 bars, trades at 20 per request
- Pine labels capped at 50 per study by default (pass `max_labels` to override)
- Pine graphics path for reading custom drawings directly: `study._graphics._primitivesCollection.dwglines.get('lines').get(false)._primitivesDataById`

## Scope boundaries (see CONTRIBUTING.md)

This is a **local bridge only**. Changes must not: connect directly to TradingView's servers (everything goes through the local Desktop app via CDP), bypass auth/subscription restrictions, scrape/cache/redistribute market data, add automated trading/order execution, or bundle/reverse-engineer TradingView's proprietary charting code.
